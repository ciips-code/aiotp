# All In One Telehealth Platform -AIOTP-

## Overview

The **All In One Telehealth Platform** (AIOTP) is an open-source software solution developed by the **Center for Implementation and Innovation in Health Policies (CIIPS)** at the **INSTITUTE FOR CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS AND HEALTH POLICY (IECS)**, in collaboration with **Integrando Salud**, and funded by the **Pan American Health Organization (PAHO/WHO)** using United States Government funds. This platform aims to improve access to healthcare for people and communities in Latin America and the Caribbean.

## Purpose

The platform was created to address the healthcare access challenges faced by remote and underserved populations. By leveraging and adapting open-source components such as [OpenEMR](https://www.open-emr.org) and [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org), the platform provides a secure, scalable, and reliable telehealth solution. Initially, the platform includes an Electronic Medical Record (EMR) module and a Telehealth module, which can be deployed jointly or independently. The ongoing development aims to expand the platform's functionality and interoperability with other systems through standard interfaces.

## Key Features

- **Open Source:** Built on open-source components, ensuring transparency and flexibility.
- **Modular Design:** Includes an EMR and Telehealth module, with additional modules under development.
- **Scalability:** Designed to be easily implemented and scaled to meet various healthcare needs.
- **Interoperability:** Capable of integrating with existing systems using standard interfaces.
- **Security:** Emphasizes secure deployment to protect patient data and ensure privacy.

## Development and Collaboration

The All In One Telehealth Platform is a collaborative effort involving multiple stakeholders. The CIIPS at IECS and Integrando Salud have led the development, with financial and strategic support from PAHO/WHO. The platform's development is ongoing, with new modules and features being added regularly to enhance its functionality and reach.
